# Technical Interview: Javascript React Test

#### _A mini test using the RecipePuppy API_


### Project
A recipe finder app using the RecipePuppy API: http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/


### Requirements
- As the user types in a search query for the name of a recipe, search results should be
displayed in a list (i.e. each time the user adds or removes a character to the search
term, the list may update).
- Only the first 20 results of a search are displayed.
- You may use a framework like create react app if this suits


### Assessment criteria
1. How well the requirements above are met
2. Code quality
3. The simplicity and extensibility of the approach taken


### Help
Please email if you have any questions about the requirements.
The purpose of this exercise is so we can assess your implementation method. Also, during the interview phase, we will discuss the technical test in more depth. It may seem like a simple set of requirements, but we're looking to evaluate style, interpretation, and implementation details.
